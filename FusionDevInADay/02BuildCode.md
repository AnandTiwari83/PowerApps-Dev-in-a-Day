# Lab 02 - Build a code component

Duration: 90 mins

### Lab Scenario

Working as part of the PrioritZ fusion team you have been asked to create a Power Apps code
component to allow drag and drop priority ranking of items in the PrioritZ Ask Power App. You will build
a code component using the React JavaScript framework. A code component approach is used to
address the requirement because there isn’t a similar control already built-in.

You have collaborated with the app makers to identify the following properties to allow them to
configure the code component in the app:

- BackgroundColor
- DragBackgroundColor
- ItemHeight
- FontSize
- FontColor

The PrioritZ Ask app will prepare a collection of the items to rank that will be bound as the dataset for
the code component. When an item is dragged and dropped the code component will raise an OnSelect
event that will be handled by the hosting app. The hosting app will update the collection items with
their new rank. The code component will be stateless.

## Exercise 1 – Build Code Component

In this exercise, you will build the code component.

### Task 1: Create the code component

1. Start **Visual Studio Code** if not already open using the shortcut available on the desktop.

   ![](../images/L04/vscode1.png)
   
2. Select the **Power Platform (1)** tab and make sure your **Dev Auth (2)** profile is selected. 
    
   >**Note** : The Power Platform tab is already installed.
    
    ![](../images/L02/L01-auth.png)

3. Click **Terminal (1)** and select **New Terminal (2).**
     
     ![](../images/L02/L02-terminal.png)

4. In the Terminal window, make a new directory by running the command below.

    ```
    md PrioritZDnDRanking
    ```
5. Run the command below to switch to the PrioritZDnRanking directory you created.

    ```
    cd PrioritZDnDRanking
    ```
6. You should now be in the directory you created. Create a new component project and install dependencies by running the below command.This will create the initial files for your code component.
    
     ```
     pac pcf init -ns ContosoCoffee --name PrioritZDnDRanking --template dataset --framework react --run-npm-install
     ```
     
     ![](../images/L02/image3.png)

7. The component framework project should be created successfully.

    ![](../images/L02/image4.png)

8. Run the command below to open the project.
    ```
    code -a.
    ```

9. If you are presented with below pop-up, click on **Yes** to trust the authors of the files.

    ![](../images/L02/image4.1.png)

10. Review the created code component files by selecting the **Explorer** tab.
    
     ![](../images/L02/L02-explorer.png)

11. Expand the **PrioritZDnDRanking** folder and then expand the sub-folder **generated**.

12. Open the **ControlManifest.Input.xml** file. The manifest is the metadata file that defines a
    component including the properties exposed to the hosting app.

      ![](../images/L02/image6.png)

13. Locate **data-set** XML element in **line number 21** in the **ControlManifest.Input.xml** file.

      ![](../images/L02/image7.png)

14. Change the **name** to **items** and the **display-name-key** to **items**. This defines the property the app will bind to a collection of items.

      ![](../images/L02/image8.png)

15. Add the following properties in between the closing tag of the data-set element `</data-set>` and opening tag of `<resources>` element.

    > Add the following properties after **line number 26** in the **ControlManifest.Input.xml** file.

    ```
    <property name="BackgroundColor" display-name-key="Background color" usage="input" of-type="SingleLine.Text" default-value="#F3F2F1"/>
    <property name="DragBackgroundColor" display-name-key="Drag background color" usage="input" of-type="SingleLine.Text" default-value="lightgreen"/>
    <property name="ItemHeight" display-name-key="Item height" usage="input" of-type="Whole.None" default-value="32"/>
    <property name="FontSize" display-name-key="Font size" usage="input" of-type="Whole.None" default-value="12"/>
    <property name="FontColor" display-name-key="Font color" usage="input" of-type="SingleLine.Text" default-value="#333333"/>
    ```

     ![](../images/L02/image9.png)

16. Locate `<resources>` section and add the below code after **code path** to add **css** resource. This will ensure that our styles will be bundled with the code component when it is deployed.

    ```
    <css path="css/PrioritZDnDRanking.css" order="1" />
    ```
    
     ![](../images/L02/image10.png)
 
      >**Note** : Please make sure not to uncomment the **resx path** as you will be facing an issue in the next task while building the code component if it's uncommented.
      
 17. Notice the following two resources. This declares the component’s dependency on these two
    libraries. This is a result of specifying –framework React on initialization.
     ```
     <platform-library name="React" version="16.8.6" />
     <platform-library name="Fluent" version="8.29.0" />
     ```
     ![](../images/L02/image11.png)
    
18. Click **File** and select **Save All** to save your changes.

19. Make sure you still have the **ControlManifest.Input.xml** file selected and then click **New Folder**.

      ![](../images/L02/image12.png)

20. Name the new folder ass **css**.

21. Select the new **css** folder you created and then click **New File**
 
     ![](../images/L02/image13.png)
 
22. Name the new file **PrioritZDnDRanking.css**

23. Paste the following css into the **PrioritZDnDRanking.css** file.
    
       ```
        .prioritydnd-scroll-container {
        box-sizing: border-box;
        padding: 2px;
        overflow-y: auto;
        overflow-x: hidden;
        position: relative;
        }
        .prioritydnd-item-container {
        user-select: none;
        display: flex;
        align-items: center;
        }
        .prioritydnd-item-column {
        margin: 8px;
        }
        
       ```
24. The file should now look like the following.

     ![](../images/L02/image14.png)

25. Click **File** and select **Save All** to save your changes.

### Task 2: Implement the component logic

1. Select the **HelloWorld.tsx** component file, right click on it and select **Delete** to remove the component file as it is automatically created and we won’t be using it. 
     
     ![](../images/L02/L02-EX1-T2-1.png)
    
2. Navigate to this path `C:\LabFiles\Developer-in-a-day\Student\L02 - Build a code component\Resources` in file explorer.
    
3. Drag the **PriorityComponent.tsx** file and drop it in the **PrioriZDnDRanking** folder.
 
4. The **PriorityComponent.tsx** file should now be in the **PrioriZDnDRanking** folder.

     ![](../images/L02/image16.png)

5. Click **File** and save your changes.
    
6. Open the **PriorityComponent.tsx** and review the contents. This implements the React
    component that will be rendered to represent our draggable items.
    
7. Notice line 9 `from react-beautiful-dnd` has a red underline. This is a npm package the
    component uses that we haven’t referenced.

     ![](../images/L02/image17.png)
 
8. Run the following command in a terminal window to add a reference to react-beautiful-dnd.

    ```
    npm install react-beautiful-dnd
    ```
    
    ![](images/L02/npm.png)
    
    >**Note** : If you receive this error **npm is not recognised**, then perform the below steps:

      1. Open PowerShell then run this command `choco install -y --force nodejs`.
      2. Oce the command execution is done, close the Visual Studio Code and open it again.
      3. Perform **Step 8** of this task again to insall the **react-beautiful-dnd** package.

9. Run the following command for the type definitions.

    ```
    npm i --save-dev @types/react-beautiful-dnd
    ```

10. Notice the red underline in line 9 has been resolved.

    ![](images/L02/react.png)
    
11. Open the **index.ts** file.
    
12. Remove the following line (line number 2 in Index.ts file) as we are no longer using HelloWorld

    ```
    import { HelloWorld, IHelloWorldProps } from "./HelloWorld";
    ```
    
    ![](../images/L02/image18.png)
 
13. Add the below code to the **index.ts** file after **line number 1**. This will reference the PriorityComponent.
    
     ```
     import { PriorityComponent, PriorityComponentProps } from './PriorityComponent';
     ```
        
     ![](../images/L02/image19.png)  
   
14. Locate the **Export** class in **line number 5**.
      
     ![](../images/L02/image20.png)
 
15. Add the following code below inside the **export** class. This defines some working variables you
    will be using in the class logic.
   
     ```
     private context: ComponentFramework.Context<IInputs>;
     private items: ComponentFramework.PropertyTypes.DataSet;
     ```
        
     ![](../images/L02/image21.png)
 
16. Locate the **init** function.
 
      ![](images/L02/init.png)
        
17. Paste the code below inside the **init** function. This logic initializes our class variables from the
    runtime values and enables resize notification.    
   
       ```
       this.context = context;
       context.mode.trackContainerResize(true);
       ```
       
       ![](images/L02/init1.png)
 
18. Locate the **updateView** function.

     ![](../images/L02/imageUpdateView.png)
 
19. Replace **updateView** function with the function below. This logic creates the React Element
    from the PriorityComponent and adds it to the virtual DOM.
  
     ```   
    public updateView(context: ComponentFramework.Context<IInputs>): React.ReactElement {
        const dataset = context.parameters.items;
        return React.createElement(PriorityComponent, {
            width: context.mode.allocatedWidth,
            height: context.mode.allocatedHeight,
            itemHeight: context.parameters.ItemHeight.raw,
            fontSize: context.parameters.FontSize.raw,
            fontColor: context.parameters.FontColor.raw,
            dataset: dataset,
            onReorder: this.onReorder,
            backgroundColor: this.context.parameters.BackgroundColor.raw,
            dragBackgroundColor:
            this.context.parameters.DragBackgroundColor.raw,
        } as PriorityComponentProps);
    }
    ```

    ![](../images/L02/image24.png)
 
20. Add the below code after the **destroy** function. This logic handles the onReorder event from
    the PriorityComponent and identifies the involved items to the hosting app as selected items.
       
    ```
    onReorder = (sourceIndex: number, destinationIndex: number): void => {
    const dataset = this.context.parameters.items;
    const sourceId = dataset.sortedRecordIds[sourceIndex];
    const destinationId = dataset.sortedRecordIds[destinationIndex];
    // raise the OnSelect event
    this.context.parameters.items.openDatasetItem(dataset.records[sourceId].getNamedReference());
    // set the SelectedItems property
    this.context.parameters.items.setSelectedRecordIds([sourceId, destinationId]);
    };
    ```
  
    ![](../images/L02/image25.png)
 
     > **Note** : **Destroy** function will be present at the end of the **PrioritZDnDRanking** class.

21. Open the **package.json** file.
    
22. Locate the **dependencies** JSON object.

      ![](../images/L02/image26.png)
 
23. Replace **dependencies** with the JSON below.

    ```
    "dependencies": {
    "@fluentui/react": "8.29.0",
    "eslint-config-prettier": "^8.5.0",
    "eslint-plugin-prettier": "^4.0.0",
    "eslint-plugin-react": "^7.29.4",
    "eslint-plugin-react-hooks": "^4.4.0",
    "eslint-plugin-sonarjs": "^0.13.0",
    "prettier": "^2.6.1",
    "react": "16.8.6",
    "react-beautiful-dnd": "^13.1.0",
    "react-dom": "16.8.6"
    },
    ```
    
24. Navigate to **.eslintric.json(1)** file from left navigation to add the new lint rule.
   
    Locate **rules(2)** in **line number 21** and paste the rules below.
   
      ```
      "no-unused-vars": ["off"],
      "no-undef": ["off"]
      ```
   
      ![](images/L02/eslint.png)

25. Click **File** and save all your changes.

26. Click **Terminal** and select **New Terminal**, if not already opened.
     
      ![](../images/L02/image27.png)

27. Run the command below. This will build your component and identify any problems.

    ```
    npm run-script build
    ```

      > **Note** : If the build operation fails with this error **`Root element is missing`**, please make sure that **resx path** is commented in the Manifest.Xml file and try to build the component again.
 
28. The build should succeed. If any errors, resolve them before proceeding.
      
       ![](../images/L02/image28.png)
 
29. Run the command below to start the test harness.
    
      ```
      npm start
      ```

30. The test harness should start, if not then copy the address and paste it in a new browser window. Try dragging the items and see if the behavior functions as
    expected.

      ![](../images/L02/imagee29.png)
 
     > **Note** : If the test harness didn't start as expected and you are not able to see the expected output as mentioned. Please verify that you have followed the previous instructions and added the code correctly in **Manifest and Index** files. 

31. Close the test harness by closing the browser tab.

32. Stop the run by holding the **[CONTROL]** key + **C**.
 
33. Type **Y** and [ENTER].
     
      ![](../images/L02/image30.png)

34. Run the command below to see your currently selected environment.
    ```
    pac org who
    ```
    
35. You should have the dev environment which is precreated for you is selected. If not, run the select command 
from the end of lab once again.

     ![](images/L02/org.png)

36. Run the command below to push the component to your environment.
    ```
    pac pcf push --publisher-prefix contoso
    ```
    
    > **Note** : 
    
     1. If the push operation fails with the error **`Sorry, the app encountered an non recoverable error and will need to terminate`**,this is a known issue with windows terminal console buffer size as commands pasted could wrap to the next line and exceeds the buffer height may result in such type of probelm sometimes, please try to run the same command couple more time to succeed in pushing the component, and also please make sure that you have followed the previous instructions and added the code correctly in **Manifest and Index** files if it is related to that.
        
        Additionally you can find the **Manifest and Index** files in the location `C:\LabFiles`, you can compare your code with these files and fix the issues if there any then retry to push the component by running the  **pac push command** again.

     2. If the run fails with nuget package error,run the below command in Powershell and try running the above command again.
    
        ```
        dotnet nuget add source https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json -n nuget.org --configfile $env:APPDATA\NuGet\NuGet.Config
        ```

    
37. Wait for the solution to be imported and published to your environment.
