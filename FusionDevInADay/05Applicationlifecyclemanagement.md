## Exercise 1 – Promote Solution to Test Environment

In this exercise, you will manually export the Contoso Badges connector solution from the Dev
environment and import it to Test environment.You will be doing this promotion manually for this 
solution so you see how it can be done. However, in a real project it could all be automated using the 
build tasks you will use in the remaining parts of this lab.

###  Task 1: Export solution.

1. Navigate to Power Apps  maker portal and make sure you are in your dev environment.

         https://make.powerapps.com

2. Select **Solutions**.

3. Select the **Contoso Badges connector** solution and click **Export Solution**.
   
     ![](../images/L03/L03-EX4-export.png)

4. On the **Before you export** blade, click **Publish** and wait for the publishing to complete.

5. Once published, click on **Next**.

6. Select **Managed** and click **Export**.

7. Wait for the solution to be exported.

8. Click Download button Right side top of the screen ,Click Download Solution.
 
    ![](../images/L03/SolutionDown1.png)
    
>**Note**: In the interest of time, we’ve only added steps to export the solution as managed. It is best 
practice to also export the unmanaged solution and keep it available for future edits if needed. The 
steps to follow are essentially the same regardless of the exported solution being managed, or 
unamanged.



###  Task 2: Import solution

1. Navigate to Power Apps maker portal if not already open and select your **Test** environment named OTU XXXXXX (default).

         https://make.powerapps.com

2. Select **Solutions** from the left-hand side menu of Power Apps.

3. Click on **Create database** to create a Dataverse database.
 
    ![](../images/L03/db1.png)

4. Leave the **Currency** and **Lanaguage** field to default and click on **Create database**.
    ![](../images/L03/db2.png)

5. Leave the page open and continue from Exercise 2 and come back again after finishing exercise 2 as portal takes time to load the solution.

   > **Note**: If solutions are not loading and getting **Try again** error this is because Power Apps takes sometime to create the Database and load the data. You can follow the below steps to fix the issue:

      1. Try refreshing the browser few times.
      2. If refresh doesn't work, try logging in to the Power Apps maker portal from private window and check solutions info.
      3. Try, signout from power apps portal and signin again.

6. Click **Import Solution**.
    
     ![](../images/L03/L03-EX5.png)

7. Click **Browse**.

8. Select the solution you exported from the Dev environment and click **Open**.

9. Click **Next**.

10. Click **Import** and wait for the import to complete.

11. The solution should import successfully.

12. Do not navigate away from this page.

## Exercise 2 – Configure a Service Principal

In this exercise, you will create service principal. The service principal will be used by the workflow
actions, so they do not execute under your individual user identity.

### Task 1: Create app registration

1. Navigate back to the browser tab in which Azure Portal is open. If not already open, navigate to Azure Portal using the below URL.

   ```
   https://portal.azure.com/
   ```

2. Open the Portal menu by clicking on the Portal menu icon, select **Microsoft Entra ID** from the list of resources.

   ![](../images/L04/L04-entra-id.png)
   
3. Select **App registrations** ***(1)*** from the side blade and click on **+ New registration** ***(2)***. This application registration will be used for the connector to access the 
   protected API.

   ![](../images/L05/L05-app-new-reg1.png)

4. Please provide the following details and click on **Register** ***(3)***.
   
   - Name: **GitHub Deploy<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />** ***(1)***
   - Supported account types: **Accounts in this organizational directory only (OTU WA AIW [SUFFIX] only - Single tenant)** ***(2)***

   ![](../images/L05/diad5l3.png).
   
5. Copy the **Application (client) ID**, **Directory(Tenant) ID**, and save it in a notepad as you need it for later use.
     
   ![](../images/L05/diad5l4.png)

6. Select **Certificates & secrets** from the side blade and click on **+ New client secret**.

   ![](../images/L05/diad5l5.png)

7. Enter **GitHub client secret<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />** ***(1)*** as description, set expiry to **90 days (3 months)** ***(2)***, and click on **Add** ***(3)***.
   
   ![](../images/L05/L05-git-secret.png)
   
8. Copy the **value** and save it in a notepad as you need it for later use.

   ![](../images/L05/diad5l7.png)

    >**Note**: Make sure to copy and paste the correct **Application (client) ID**, **Directory(Tenant) ID** and **Secret** value. Copying the incorrect value will result in issues in the next steps/tasks.
